Thank you guys!
===============

My special thanks to Beno√Æt Chesneau and Jesper Noehr for restkit and piston
(respectively), their reactivity and thoughts on the project.

Martin Skala made an impressive work on maintenance and improvements of the 
library in early 2012. This is highly rewarding and motivating as an 
Open-Source project.

It has to be said.
